1.	“public/”: This folder contains static assets that can be accessed directly from the browser, such as images, fonts, and other files.
2.	“src/’: This is the main source code directory.
3.	“pages/”: This is where your application's pages are defined. Each .js or .jsx file inside this folder corresponds to a route in your application.
4.	“components/”: This folder is meant for your React components that are reusable across different pages.
5.	“styles/”: You can put your CSS or other styling-related files here. The globals.css file can be used for global styles.

7.	“package.json”: This file contains metadata about the project and its dependencies. It also includes scripts for running various commands, such as starting the development server.
8.	“README.md”: This is the project's documentation file. You can provide information about the project, how to set it up, and any other relevant details.
